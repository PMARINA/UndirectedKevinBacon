<p>Write a program, YI_KevinBaconSG.java to generate a Symbol Graph "like" in the above image. Prompt the user for how many degrees of separation from a vertex, in this case Kevin Bacon and draw a graph with the name of the performers and the movies they are connected with. </p>
<p>I also attached files that might help you implement your program.<i>See repository files: Graph.java, In.java, BreadthFirstPaths.java, DegreesOfSeparation.java, Movies.txt, ST.java, SymbolGraph.java, StdIn.java, StdDraw.java, image above</i></p>
<p><em>NOTE</em>: Even though there is input for the number of degrees of freedom, you can make the assumption that the number would not be more than 2. This will simplify your implementation. Maybe, some of you might want to continue to develop it for a higher degree of separation as a final project.</p>
<p>Optional: draw your own "Kevin Bacon Graph" with you in the center and a limited number of friends and their friends to make this assignment manageable. </p>
